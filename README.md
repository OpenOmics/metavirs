    This is the home of the pipeline, metavirs. Its long-term goals: are to assemble, annotate, and screen environmental samples like no pipeline before!
  </i>
</div>

## Overview
Welcome to metavirs! Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through [metavirs' documentation](https://openomics.github.io/metavirs/).

The **`./metavirs`** pipeline is composed of several inter-related subcommands to set up and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub-commands performs different functions: 

 * [<code>metavirs <b>run</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/metavirs/usage/run/): Run the metavirs pipeline with your input files.
 * [<code>metavirs <b>unlock</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/metavirs/usage/unlock/): Unlocks a previous runs output directory.
 * [<code>metavirs <b>install</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/metavirs/usage/install/): Download reference files locally.
 * [<code>metavirs <b>cache</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/metavirs/usage/cache/): Cache software containers locally.


metavirs is a comprehensive viral metagenomics pipeline to assemble, annotate, and classify microorganisms in environmental samples. It relies on technologies like [Singularity<sup>1</sup>](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) to maintain the highest level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by [Snakemake<sup>2</sup>](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster.

The pipeline is compatible with data generated from Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. As input, it accepts a set of FastQ files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users. 

Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the [usage](https://openomics.github.io/metavirs/usage/run/) section of each available sub-command.

For more information about issues or troubleshooting a problem, please check out our [FAQ](https://openomics.github.io/metavirs/faq/questions/) prior to [opening an issue on Github](https://github.com/OpenOmics/metavirs/issues).

## Dependencies
**Requires:** `singularity>=3.5`  `snakemake<=7.32.3`

At the current moment, the pipeline only has two dependencies: snakemake and singularity. With that being said, [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) and [singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/all-releases) must be installed on the target system. Snakemake orchestrates the execution of each step in the pipeline. To guarantee the highest level of reproducibility, each step of the pipeline relies on versioned images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/skchronicles/metavirs).
